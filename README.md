GymFocus_Android
================

Android app developped for the StartUp Weekend Montreal (11 to 14 of July 2013) in 28hours straight

This application communicates with the website http://app.gymfocus.co/
The website repository is there : https://github.com/hackinghealthca/gymfocus

I want to thanks my team, kickstartr-android, and all the mentors that helped us during this week and particularly Gina Cook that showed me a lot of things about android
